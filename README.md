# gen_cnames

`gen_cnames.py` has been written to add support of custom domain usage for hashbang users.

Basically it reads a list of custom domains from `.CNAME` in each user's home directory and renders
them using [mustache](//mustache.github.io) templates.

_Note that the Python version is the main one and other versions are written by us just for exercising those languages..._
